# Few-Shot-Learning-for-Intent-Detection-using-PyTorch
Few shot learning framework for Intent Detection using PyTorch and Huggingface. We us cross encoders and parameteric similarity functions for pairwise matching query samples with support samples. We implement balanced and unbalanced samplers to simulate a real world setting where each support set class may not have equal number of samples.
